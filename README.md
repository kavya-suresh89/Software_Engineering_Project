# Software_Engineering_Project
A social website built especially for the college by a team of 5 students for our first year Software engineering class. 
ITUBUZZ allows students, alumni and faculty to create accounts and login to our social networking site.
Here, users can check general posts, reply or comment on them. 
Another module known as the Knowledge forum allows users to ask questions and also reply to the questions asked by other users.
Users can also form groups such as clubs for more private meetings and posts. The admin can add more members to the group.
